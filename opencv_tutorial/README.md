# OpenCV tutorial
That chapter was directed to get basic knowledge about computer vision and how to harness the OpenCV to it. I learnt about:
- input-ouput operations
- cropping, resizing image
- colorspaces (bgr, rgb, grayscale and hsv)
- blurring (standard, gaussian and median blur)
- thresholds (global and adaptive thresholds)
- edge detection
- drawing (circles, lines etc.)
- contours
